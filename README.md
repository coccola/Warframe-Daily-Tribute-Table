# This Project
In the **Warframe** online game published by **Digital Extremes**, a reward is earned on the first login of a day, and the rewards increase according to the amount of days logged in. This project's objective is creating a table (PDF file) that shows how the rewards increase with login days.

# Considerations
* The rewards are listed regardless of the existence of special rewards. For example, on login day 100 a Milestone reward is earned instead of what's on the table.
* Only the rewards that increase with login days are listed; there are other rewards.
* "Login period" is "Login days" converted to a continuous period (**y**ears, **m**onths and **d**ays).
* The information that made this project possible is at https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Daily_Tribute.
